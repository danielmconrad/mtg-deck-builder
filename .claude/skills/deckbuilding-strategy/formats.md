# Magic formats (Moxfield's list)

These are the formats in Moxfield's deck-format dropdown, as of October 2026, with the deckbuilding rules that matter here. Use the names when talking to the user or when they set a deck's format on Moxfield. Ban lists and points lists change often, so check the linked source or the card cache before relying on one. This repo's deck files support only three formats (see [Repo formats](#repo-formats)).

Where a **Scryfall key** is given, every cached card has that legality (`legal`, `not_legal`, `restricted` or `banned`), so card legality comes from the cache, not memory. Formats without a key are fan formats Scryfall doesn't track. Moxfield checks some of them, but this repo can't.

## Repo formats

| `format` in `deck.yaml` | Repo rules                                                                                                   | Closest Moxfield format                                                                                    |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `commander`             | Exactly 100 with commanders, singleton                                                                       | Commander / EDH                                                                                            |
| `standard-brawl`        | Exactly 60 with commanders, singleton, Standard Brawl legality (`standardbrawl` key), planeswalkers can lead | Standard Brawl. Moxfield's plain **Brawl** is MTG Arena's 100-card format, which the repo doesn't support. |
| `casual-60`             | At least 60, up to 4 copies, no sanctioned rules                                                             | None (Moxfield's "None")                                                                                   |

## Commander-style formats

All use a commander in the command zone and singleton decks (one copy of each card except basic lands), and the deck's colors must match the commander's color identity unless noted.
